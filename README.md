# Article Summarization

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Text Rank algorithm, inspired by Google's Page Rank algorithm, specifically for summarizing non-premium articles on Medium.

## Features:

- Summarizes non-premium articles from Medium.
- Utilizes the Text Rank algorithm for generating summaries.
- Easy to use and integrate into your projects.

## Requirements:

Before running the summarizer, ensure you have the necessary packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

## Installation:

1. Clone the Respository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Article_Summarization
```
3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How It Works:

The summarizer works by following these steps:
  - Fetches the content of the provided Medium article.
  - Processes the text to identify the most important sentences.
  - Ranks these sentences using the Text Rank algorithm.
  - Generates a concise summary based on the highest-ranked sentences.
